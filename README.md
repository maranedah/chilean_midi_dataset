# Chilean Song Annotation Project
---
Welcome to the Chilean Song Annotation Project! This GitHub repository contains a collection of Chilean songs annotated into MIDI files. The main objective of this project is to generate data that can be used for the analysis of musical patterns and gain insights into the musical history of Chile. Additionally, the annotated data can serve as a valuable resource for training various machine learning algorithms, such as audio-to-MIDI conversion and music generation.

## Dataset
---
The dataset in this repository comprises a diverse range of Chilean songs from different eras, genres, and regions. Each song is provided in the MIDI format, which allows for efficient representation of musical information, including notes, chords, and timing. MIDI files also enable easy integration with various music software and libraries, facilitating further analysis and processing.

The dataset is organized into subdirectories for each chilean artist. This organization ensures easy navigation and helps researchers or developers focus on specific subsets of the data, depending on their interests or requirements.

## Usage
---
The Chilean Song Annotation Project can be utilized in various ways, including but not limited to:

* Musical Analysis: Researchers, musicians, and enthusiasts can explore the dataset to study the musical characteristics of Chilean songs. The annotated MIDI files provide valuable information about melodies, harmonies, rhythms, and other musical elements, enabling detailed analysis and comparisons between different compositions.

* Musical History: The dataset serves as a resource for understanding the evolution of Chilean music. By analyzing the annotated songs, researchers can gain insights into the cultural and historical context of different eras and regions within Chile, tracing the development of musical styles and traditions.

* Machine Learning: The annotated dataset can be employed for training machine learning algorithms in various music-related tasks. For instance, researchers can use the data to develop models for audio-to-MIDI conversion, allowing the conversion of Chilean audio recordings into MIDI files for further analysis. Furthermore, the dataset can be used to train models for music generation, enabling the creation of new compositions inspired by Chilean music.
